# Rock Paper Scissors
A Small Machine Learning Project by Mark Coolidge

## About
This was a simple project made over a couple of hours using Ultralytics' YOLO26L as a base.

The model was then trained on a dataset of Rock Paper Scissors games.

Both the training code and the runtime code are in this repo under training and runtime, respectively.

## Running
To run this project, your computer must have a webcam.

This project requires both OpenCV and Ultralytics to be installed through pip.

To play, run main.py in the /runtime folder.

After the screen shows ROCK PAPER SCISSORS, throw out your pick so the webcam can see it.
